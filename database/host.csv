Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Originally from South Florida, I now am an MBA student at the Yale School of Management.  I love to travel.

I have yet to go to Canada (despite being a few hours drive away now) and haven't been to Africa, so both of those are on my list.

I'm a NY-native architecture student with a background in fashion. I lived in Europe for +10 years, but sadly never travelled much beyond that.

Due to the workload I often stay over in the studio and skip going home, sometimes for several days. But don't worry, we have showers and lockers! It's common for students to be semi-homeless in this major. So while I'm pulling all nighters at school, you can at least enjoy what I'm missing out on. Also, you'll actually see some of my old models scattered around the place! :)

Big music fan here as well: dark wave, synthpop, industrial, it goes on. (Psst: once you're all settled in the apartment, you'll be able to easily play your own music on the large vintage Technics speakers, straight from your phone)

When bored, and finally at home, I tinker around the apartment or rearrange everything until I pass out. As cheesy as this may be, I consider it my baby and I finally decided to start sharing it with the world.

For every guest, I leave a few notes scattered around the apartment with hints or instructions for your convenience. I also labelled drawers and cabinets with most commonly used items.

Finally! I also provide maps, official NYC guides, local restaurant menus and some personal recommendations for my favorite underground spots around the city. If there are also some promising upcoming events around the corner, I'll make sure to include that as well.

We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021.

I've been a member of the Airbnb community since their early launch. As a host I've discovered my passion for travel and hospitality. Within the many destinations I have been granted the opportunity to go to, I've found something special in each and every place. 
That has helped me host in various scenarios and various countries, starting with New York, my home,  to Miami, Mexico City and Tulum. 

Through life and situations, I've been granted opportunities in the restaurant industry and grown into becoming a bartender. Career that I've enjoyed and has put my people skills to work. This has also thought me to multitask and have keen attention to detail. Skills that I like to use as a host. 


As a fervent traveler, I try to focus on the destination as a whole. Being a New Yorker has thought me that simple is more. And precise is pragmatic.

912,Denise,2015/8/4,"New York, NY","Hello, I am female, single (divorced/widowed) Entertainment Professional. I like people but I am busy and keep to myself much of the time, but if a guests needs my help with something or an ear to listen, I try to be there for them within reason. I always try to make anyone who rents my spare room feel at home by taking them around the neighborhood, introducing them to special vendors to get good 'deals' and neighbors to help look out for them if I'm not around. I am open and easy to talk to. I am happy to invite my guests to events that may interest them or take them on hikes or bike rides or museum visits if I am going and they would like to come along. 
I am a spiritual person, and although I do attend church from time to time, I am not super religious. I respect the political and religious views of others as long as they are not harmful in anyway. I have traveled the world so I enjoy having people from other cultures in my home. I do not 'date' people who rent my room. I am heterosexual, but have had gay male and female roommates. I'm clean and neat and expect the same from guests. I do not smoke and  only drink an occasional glass of wine or cocktail at an event. 
Can't think of anything else at this precise moment but happy to answer any questions anyone has for me.

All the best!
Denise

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

I've been a member of the Airbnb community since their early launch. As a host I've discovered my passion for travel and hospitality. Within the many destinations I have been granted the opportunity to go to, I've found something special in each and every place. 
That has helped me host in various scenarios and various countries, starting with New York, my home,  to Miami, Mexico City and Tulum. 

Through life and situations, I've been granted opportunities in the restaurant industry and grown into becoming a bartender. Career that I've enjoyed and has put my people skills to work. This has also thought me to multitask and have keen attention to detail. Skills that I like to use as a host. 


As a fervent traveler, I try to focus on the destination as a whole. Being a New Yorker has thought me that simple is more. And precise is pragmatic.

Welcome to my great international family in New York. Let me show you around.
I live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. 
 I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.
As a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.
In addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC.

I work in tech 鈥?we are building something new and exciting with my team! Since COVID started, I've been working remotely and currently spend my weekdays at home on Zoom calls.

After work, I try to get out of the house. I love riding my bike, meeting friends in the neighborhood, coffee walks, or anything that involves getting some fresh air after staring at my screen all day.

I am one of those people who are always on the go or starting new projects. My other hobbies are craft projects, event planning, interior design, learning new skills like pottery or reading tarot, cooking, and traveling, obviously. Miss those traveling days.

My home is my place to calm down and I like to keep it clean and pretty. I love to host guests 鈥?I want to make sure everyone feels comfortable and welcome at my place. Even though I do prefer clean and considerate guests :) I moved to my current place very recently and things are still finding their places. 

This is my third apartment in Williamsburg and after all these years, I  know the area really well. I would love to help you to find the best local spots and give you insight tips. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

I've been a member of the Airbnb community since their early launch. As a host I've discovered my passion for travel and hospitality. Within the many destinations I have been granted the opportunity to go to, I've found something special in each and every place. 
That has helped me host in various scenarios and various countries, starting with New York, my home,  to Miami, Mexico City and Tulum. 

Through life and situations, I've been granted opportunities in the restaurant industry and grown into becoming a bartender. Career that I've enjoyed and has put my people skills to work. This has also thought me to multitask and have keen attention to detail. Skills that I like to use as a host. 


As a fervent traveler, I try to focus on the destination as a whole. Being a New Yorker has thought me that simple is more. And precise is pragmatic.

from MGM. There is a soulfulness loved by the authentic locals as well as the out of Towner鈥檚 that gravitate here. The sensation of high energy is brought about by the contrast of old New York with the vigor of visitors to a burgeoning city. It's just the perfect scene to begin a story of your own or with someone of your choosing. There is room to mix in the crowd or make yourself noticed in a myriad of settings for human interaction; something surely missed in our time of impersonal communication. Any article about Orchard Street is incomplete without the newsworthy story of how the soul of a 5-story tenement filled with artifacts and personal affects became a stately eighth story hotel. Only a visit to the Historic Blue Moon can make one really understand how only on Orchard Street could art and history collide into such an elegant design.
The Historic Blue Moon was chosen as one in hundred and fifty hotels in the Western Hemisphere to check into by National Geographic as well as the recipient of over forty major articles.

I remember the first time I was given a tour of Ridgewood/ Bushwick, and fell in love! I immediately decided to settle here!  :)  I would like to add that after a long or exhilarating day in NYC, I love nothing more than coming to a tranquil home and I believe that you will too! Now, I believe that you will love this neighborhood as much as I do because for starters; Forest Park lights up during the summer with all sorts of activities and concerts. Our wonderful public library is within walking distance. There are also many places of worship and a bodega on 'almost' every corner.  The shopping is also within walking distance and so is mass transit. And our Stop N Shops and Trader Joe鈥檚 do give Whole Foods a 鈥榣il鈥?competition. There are private gyms that offer individualized training and both Planet Fitness and Lucille Roberts have recently added state of the art facilities located 3-4 blocks from my home. In the 鈥榗oiffure鈥?department, we have barber shops for the guys; and European hairdressers intermixed with Dominican Salons (the latter performed miracles on my crazy hair!) for the ladies. There is also a plethora of ethnic restaurants that are worth every bite and reasonable too! There are art exhibitions all throughout Queens and plenty of jazz/dancing venues too. Oh! And did I mention all the sports arenas, Theaters on Broadway, and the brand new giant Ship aka The Barclays Center?! Yes, we have those for your entertainment and more; The Rockaways, Flushing Meadows Park (think World鈥檚 Fair) and Jacob Riis State Park are perfect during the warm months. And lastly, I am centrally located or as I like to call it 2O/2O/2O鈥? during non-rush hours it takes twenty minutes from La Guardia Airport, 20 minutes from JFK Airport, and 20 minutes into Manhattan via L train. Hope to see you soon!  :)",within a day,0.80 ,0.78 ,t,Ridgewood,2,8,"['email', 'phone']",t,t

I'd say oevrall I've a lover of life, generally optimistic and open-minded. I have many passions but here's a little about what I love to do on a regular basis:

-Continually explore and discover New York (sort of a ""tourist in my own home."") Luckily with this town, it's large and diverse enough so that you don't ever have to have the same night twice...

-Cook/dine/eat. I love food, trying new restaurants, kinds of cuisines, and also making some of my own.

-Writing and music. I'm a blogger, freelance editor, and self-proclaimed ""deep thinker."" Love to constantly analyze and absorb the world around me, which I often translate into words. I'm also a DJ on the side; I love all types of music.

-Hanging out with and staying in touch w/the people I love. There's nothing like life's ""natural medicine"" - your friends, family, and loved ones - to help keep everything ""real"" and in perspective.

I love a lot of movies, but am a bit of a ""TV head"" these days. Here are some of my favorites: The Office, 30 Rock, Modern Family, Mad Men, Weeds, How I Met Your Mother, Seinfeld, Friends, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Law & Order SVU. 

In terms of hosting: I'm a fairly courteous houseguest; ethical, minding my space, cleaning up after myself, and keeping in mind other who might be staying or living with me. I'd expect the same from anyone I'd host.


I'd love to rent my space out to you!!!

The pup will not be on the same floor as you, but you may cross paths when using the kitchen or shower ~ I will make sure a proper greeting is arranged and there will always be an abundance of treats available if you choose to try and win him over :)))  Otherwise, he will generally be confined to my bedroom when I am not at home. There is also a kitty here, so please, if you are coming with your own animals, make sure to keep them confined to your room at all times to ensure everyone's safety and well being.


Happy travels and I look forward to meeting you!!

------MY airbnb experience--------
This Summer I traveled to Amsterdam for a large family gathering.  My relatives came from Latvia, Australia, Germany, California, NY and England.  There were 15 of us, staying in five places.  The hosts and Airbnb made it possible.  It was wonderful.  Since then I wanted to become a member.  

About me, I grew up in NYC, have lived in a number of places including Nice, Geneva, Adelaide, Vitoria, Brazil and California.  I've traveled extensively.  After graduating from college a friend and I went by bicycle through England, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Czech republic, Hungary, Russia, China, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Austrlia.  I love being able to immerse myself in the local culture and see how people live.   For this, Airbnb has been fantastic.

My interests include seeing live music, comedy and dance.  I go to mostly local places near to where I live.  

I work for a social network software company that allows individuals to become part of a community with local non profits.

27 Year Old Medical Student.

Born and raised in New York City.

I have travelled almost all of Europe, parts of Middle East-Asia, and some of Latin America.

I believe that travelling and meeting new people is an essential part of being a well-rounded person, and a crucial element for everyone who has ever been curious about the world and its mysteries.

After having travelled so much I began to realize the importance of find a comfortable place to stay and the difficulties in finding such a place 鈥?as to why I began hosting with AirBnb, to help other fellow travellers find a comfortable place to stay.

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

*I can speak Japanese as well! Please feel free to contact me in Japanese.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Welcome to my great international family in New York. Let me show you around.
I live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. 
 I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.
As a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.
In addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the (Website hidden by Airbnb) location is located a block or a few blocks from  subway stations.

Um, born in China, moved to Sweden at a young age, then to Tempe and Tucson, AZ, then to Bloomburg, PA (the only town!), finally to New York for college. Been here since, but my heart belongs elsewhere (swoon -- but where? who knows). Finally moved to Brooklyn in August of 2015, and now just living the vagabond life. Well, not really, but trying to travel more. While I'm gone, mi casa es su casa!


A few more tidbits about me...

I love music and food, and everything in between. Always up to try new things. Can dance like a nut. Don't prefer eating nuts but will happily do so since it's sustenance.

Despite appearances, I haven't traveled all that much, but I am actively looking to change that. Gonna make my first trip outside of North/Central America--not including traveling with parents to China to visit relatives--very soon, will update this bio when that happens, maybe.

Traveling -- I like to travel light, stay in local places, don't cause a scene, make the bed each morning (hey I've read it's good for your mental well-being).

Hosting -- I host friends and family so often, and have been given 5/5 stars on each occasion, except that one time when I didn't wake up my friend to move his car and she got a parking ticket, but c'mon that ain't my responsibility. Kidding aside, I'm really chill, all about mutual respect, etc. If I'm home I'll even make coffee!

4024,Kurt,2013/10/20,"New York, NY","PLEASE NOTE:  DUE TO COVID-19, AND SARS-CoV-2, THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19, I HAVE ESTABLISHED RIGOROUS CLEANING PROCEDURES THAT HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED IN MY APARTMENT SINCE FEBRUARY 2020, AND THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN AIRBNB STAYS, BEFORE GUESTS ARRIVE, AND DURING STAYS AFTER GUESTS RETURN TO THE APARTMENT, SPECIFICALLY:

1.  CLEANING TOUCHABLE SURFACES WITH CDC-APPROVED ""FANTASTIK DISINFECTANT"", OR PROPERLY DILUTED BLEACH, ON ALL COMMON TOUCHABLE SURFACES.

2.  SURGICAL GLOVES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL GUESTS WHO WANT TO USE THEM, EITHER OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT OR INSIDE.  

THESE GLOVES ARE WASHABLE, AND CAN ALSO BE STERILIZED WITH COVID SANITIZERS, WHICH IS ADVISABLE BECAUSE RUBBER GLOVES PICK UP BACTERIA AND VIRUSES, BUT THEY PROVIDE A BARRIER FOR YOUR HANDS IF STERILIZED.

3.  ALL BEDDING WILL BE LAUNDERED IN HOT WATER AND SOAP BETWEEN STAYS.  GUESTS MAY DO THEIR LAUNDRY IN THE BASEMENT.

4.  THE BATHROOM SHOWER/TUB, INCLUDING THE GLASS DOORS, WILL BE CLEANED AND THEN SANITIZED BETWEEN STAYS WITH FANTASTIK DISINFECTANT, THE FLOORS WILL BE CLEANED BETWEEN STAYS, AND THE TOILET WILL BE CLEANED/DISINFECTEDWITH BLEACH.

Other than with the rigorous cleaning I have instituted, lol, I'm very easy going and easy to be around.  

I ALWAYS WEAR A MASK AND SURGICAL GLOVES WHEN I GO OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT, AND I UNDRESS IN MY BEDROOM, STERILIZE MY 2 MASKS AND GLOVES AFTER THAT, WASH AND THEN CHANGE CLOTHES. 

I sterilize any knobs or light switches I touched when I entered. 

I do NOT expect guests to do the same, but I will clean doorknobs and light switches after guests return, and I will maintain an appropriate distance if and when my Airbnb guests want me to socialize with them.

I will not have neighbor or other visitors.

I tend to like guests who are responsible, who can be independent, and who will try to keep the kitchen and bathroom basically clean, although I and my roommate will also be cleaning in those areas. 

Although the guest bathroom is shared with one person between 6 or 7 P.M. and 6:30 A.M., my apartment roommate in the smaller bedroom is very clean.  I use the 2nd bathroom, which is in my bedroom (ensuite).

I am friendly and don't mind hanging out with guests sometimes, but I keep to myself when I'm home.   

Occasional smoking will be ok in the guest room, with the door closed and a window open, but outside smoking would be even better.

The apartment is only 3 flights up from the marble lobby/1st floor.  It is advised to bring luggage that isn't very heavy or to have luggage on rollers.  

A TV is not provided but light breakfast items can be, if requested (most people have not been using the ones I was providing, so English Muffins and mini bagels for toasting, buttery spread, jelly, cream cheese, a few pieces of fruit or juice can be provided upon request). 

Laundry facilities are available in the basement. 

The major benefits of this apartment are the nice decor, art works and furnishings; a large kitchen and living room; cleanliness and neatness of the place; very close proximity to many transportation lines, both subways and buses, and many taxis and car services; quick access to midtown and downtown; immediate access to Central Park (across the street); and very quick access to NYC's main museums (on ""Museum Mile""), Columbia University, many different nearby restaurants that also deliver food, nearby nightspots, and numerous very good nearby supermarkets.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.00 ,f,Harlem,1,2,"['email', 'phone']",t,t

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable.

鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.

鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here.

I'm the resident manager of an elaborate historic home with gardens and available space--both in my heart and in my agenda--for the housing, protection, and entertainment of temporary visitors to New York City.  Whereas my office and residence are on the upper floors, AirBnB guests occupy the rather grand formal areas on the ground floor. Lower Manhattan is easily accessible via a ten-minute walk and a 22-minute (free) ferryboat ride.  This is country living in the city, with lots of cultural, historic, and razzmatazz literary sideshows.   

Magnolia House results from my 30-year role as co-author of many titles, and many editions, of The Frommer Guides, each of which included evaluations of the bed and breakfast inns of Europe. 

Edgy media associations have always been part of the Magnolia House experience. Previous guests have included Tennessee Williams (鈥淢agnolia House reminds me of Blanche DuBois鈥?lost plantation, Bellereve!鈥?, golden age film personality Joan Blondell (a close friend of celebrity biographer and co-owner, Darwin Porter), Lucille Lortel (the philanthropic but very temperamental Queen of Off-Broadway), the very outspoken Jolie Gabor (mother of the three 鈥淏ombshells from Budapest鈥?otherwise known as  Zsa Zsa, Eva, and Magda) and a host of other stars, starlettes, and demi-mondains of all descriptions and persuasions. 

鈥淐onjoining this rambling old house with the hospitality trades is a logical move, considering how inter-related the memorabilia is.鈥?Prince continued, 鈥淎nd after years researching and writing the world鈥檚 pre-eminent travel series, I鈥檓 alert to the hopes, dreams, and needs, and aesthetics of temporary visitors. Welcome to Magnolia House.鈥? 

Celebrity Associations:  In the kitchen of Magnolia House, two fabulous women, Zsa Zsa's mother, JOLIE GABOR, working with the  great European cabaret singer, GRETA KELLER, prepared lavish dinners based on recipes of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. (Their favorite dish was roast goose with apricot and chestnut stuffing.)  The indiscretions that accompanied the meal eventually re-appeared in the award-winning, widely reviewed THOSE GLAMOROUS GABORS, BOMBSHELLS FROM BUDAPEST, a biography co-authored by Magnolia House's resident managers and published by BLOOD MOON PRODUCTIONS, the independent publishing entity located upstairs. Ask us about it. It's only one of Magnolia House's hundreds of celebrity associations that illustrate the high-octane sweep of ""THE AMERICAN CENTURY."" 

QUESTION: Why is one of the two bedrooms at Magnolia House named ""The Roosevelt Room?""  Because you'll sleep in the queen-sized bed that used to be owned by a former U.S. President, Theodore (Teddy) ""Rough Rider"" Roosevelt. 

There a sense of magic in this wise, mysterious old house, and historic links to ""celebrities"" we're eager to ""introduce you to. They include former First Lady Julia Gardiner Tyler, the pre-Civil War ""Marie Antoinette"" of the White House; important players in the early days of Silent Films;  and household names from  media, show-biz, pop culture, and politics. 

Be welcome, be happy, and pleasant dreams, in advance, to all of you.

P.S. Now, There鈥檚 a GUIDEBOOK to accompany your visit to one of Staten Island鈥檚 Most Intriguing Historic Landmarks:

Blood Moon Productions proudly announces the release of an illustrated history of Magnolia House, a historic home in Saint George  that鈥檚 internationally famous for its associations with celebrities.

Its authors, celebrity journalists Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince, describe it as a 230-page 鈥減amphlet,鈥?the first in their new series about how travel writing for THE鈥團ROMMER鈥圙UIDES evolved into a celebrity adventure. 

STATEN ISLAND鈥橲 HISTORIC MAGNOLIA HOUSE:鈥圕ELEBRITY & THE IRONIES OF FAME is available now through Amazon, Barnes&Noble, and as a free giveaway to anyone overnighting or stopping in for an 鈥淓xperience鈥?at Magnolia House  as organized by Airbnb. For more information about either the book or the 鈥淎irBnb Experience鈥?with the same name,  search the internet for 鈥淐elebrity &鈥坱he Ironies of Fame.鈥?鈥?

As stated by Danforth Prince, Blood Moon鈥檚 President and Director of Development, 鈥淲hereas a conventional autobiography of either of us would have been too boring and too embarrassing, we opted instead to filter this memoir through the lens of the historic monument that witnessed鈥攗p close and intimately鈥攕ome of the most widely celebrated characters of 鈥淭he American Century.鈥? 

Staten Island鈥檚 Historic Magnolia House, Celebrity & the Ironies of Fame:鈥?
A Memoir About Travel Guides, Tabloid Expos茅s, & the Landmark Where They Were Produced.  
 
Softcover, 6鈥?x 9鈥? with 230 pages, at least a hundred photos, and scads of gossip about who did what to whom during the course of 50 years as the world鈥檚 pre-eminent travel journalists. ISBN (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) . 

Our conclusion? Magnolia House is NOT the typical AirBnb--nor is it anything remotely like a Hilton or a Day's Inn.  It's a private home with stories about the aftermath of the Civil War to convey. It's unique in America, and it's eager to show you its secrets. 

WHAT IS MAGNOLIA鈥圚OUSE?

The name it bears has been on record with Staten Island鈥檚 Borough Hall for at least a century, as it鈥檚 a byproduct of owners who, in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, gave it a name that evoked their native Virginia. Dating from the (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) s, it鈥檚 a Grande Dame with a knack for nourishing high-functioning eccentrics.  

Many of them have lived or been entertained here since New York鈥檚 State Senator Howard Bayne, a transplanted Southerner, moved in with his wife, the daughter of the Surgeon General of the Confederate States of America, in the aftermath of that bloodiest of wars on North American soil, the War between the American States.

Since then, many dozens of celebrities鈥攕ome of them notorious鈥攈ave whispered their secrets and rehearsed their ambitions within its walls. According to some, a few of them remain on site, working through the issues that tormented or perplexed them during their earthy and raucous experiences in the here and now.

This is the story of how this 鈥淲ise Victorian Lady鈥濃€攊n its role as the editorial headquarters for many of THE鈥團ROMMER鈥圙UIDES and later for BLOOD MOON PRODUCTIONS鈥攁dapted to America鈥檚 frequently changing tastes, times, circumstances, and values.  

This new ""Guidebook,"" from a writing team well-versed in the nuances of writing guidebooks, is available now through internet purveyors everywhere, it's the first in Blood Moon鈥檚 MAGNOLIA鈥圚OUSE series, books that explore the oddities, and 鈥渙nly in America鈥?eccentricities of THE鈥圓MERICAN鈥圕ENTURY and how they unfolded within Staten Island鈥檚 most media-centric historic landmark.

We are a big, beautiful household made up of a diverse and welcoming group of young people, and one shy cat, and the best part is that we all really enjoy each other's company. 

You will often find at least two or three people in the backyard, chatting and sharing a beer. That being said, it is important to note that we are not a party house. Also important to note is that, however much we enjoy hanging out, we are also all very respectful of each other's privacy - we never feel obliged to socialize.

Your room is on the main floor of this three-story, nine-bedroom brownstone. It's a small but cozy room, with natural light coming in through a single window. The bathroom is shared with one or two other roommates, and the kitchen is shared between three - both are located on the ground floor.

Everyone's schedules tend to be so different, we have never really experienced much trouble with the bathrooms or the kitchen (we actually have a total of 3 bathrooms and two kitchens). We also have a shared living room on the ground floor.

If our living situation sparks any sort of excitement into you - come stay with us. Maybe you'll find that you will fall in love with our home, just as much as we have.

See you soon!

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Some of the places I've been are Morocco, Italy, Colombia, Egypt, Cuba, Israel, Argentina, Poland, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic as well as many of the American States. When I'm not writing I can be found walking my adopted dog Justice to the Saint Nicholas dog park for some fun in the sun. I grew up in Denver Colorado but have lived in New York for 28 years and counting. I am familiar with much of NYC and I can't imagine living in any other place.  My home in Harlem suits me because it's in an energetic, vibrant, and diverse community. My neighborhood is a wonderful place to live and I'm always meeting new people thanks to Justice. On some nights I like to go to the local lounge and listen to Jazz, soul, and blues music. 

I love Film and am happy to share my film collection with you. I have hundreds of my favorite movies and you can watch any of them. A few of my favorites are True Romance, A Clockwork Orange, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Cool Hand Luke, Taxi Driver, and The Princess Bride. 

I ask that you treat my home with the same respect you would expect from me in your home. That means being respectful of my neighbors and community. Putting things back in their place for the next guest to enjoy, and caring for my property as you care for your own. In other words my home is your home. Welcome to Harlem NYC!

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Shortly after graduating, I moved back to New York City to be closer to my family. Within 4 short years of living here, I purchased a house in Brooklyn in February of 2018. 

I work for a medical company here in Brooklyn and have a lot of hobbies. One of my biggest hobbies is saltwater fish tanks, which lead me to my next favorite hobby of scuba diving! I try to scuba dive around the world at least twice a year. 

I also own two motorcycles and ride them all over the country with friends. I love to snowboard in the winter time when I am not riding motorcycles. 

I love to travel. I have scuba dived in many places, ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, zip lined the jungles in Costa Rica, snowmobiled mountains on the east coast, partied hard in Berlin, Germany, sailed the Exuma Islands, Bahamas, swam with sharks, raced motorcycles, and the list continues to grow. 

I love to cook, travel, ride motorcycles, run around New York City, drink with friends, listen to hip-hop, and live my life to the fullest!

When it comes to you living in my home I am sure to give you your space! I am always here to help guide you around New York City. I have plenty of recommendations for foods, bars, clubs, museums, parks, hidden gems, etc. I know Brooklyn like the back of my hand and am always here to help :)

I'm a Montreal-born, Tokyo-raised former television and radio producer who truly considers the world my home--and is delighted that Brooklyn, specifically, has been my base and launchpad for the past 25 years.

Since getting divorced a few years ago, and with my girls growing up, I've turned my Prospect Heights brownstone into a part-time arts salon. Once or twice a month, I'll host a storytelling evening, or a pop-up art show, or a festive cooking class, or a writing workshop, or a meditation gathering. All are welcome. It's been a joy.

I'm a passionate believer and supporter of ""the sharing economy,"" of which Airbnb plays an essential part. I barely ever use hotels any more--just feel the texture of traveling (and hosting) through Airbnb is made deeper, more idiosyncratic, and more fun when I can connect with real people on their own, or my, turf.

When I was a growing up, my mother enjoyed telling her children that ""strangers are friends we haven't met yet."" I've come to find that this is mostly true. So here's to you, stranger--and the lovely possibility of our one day meeting.

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

*I can speak Japanese as well! Please feel free to contact me in Japanese.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. Then I moved to Cincinnati, Ohio to go to college at Xavier University. 

Shortly after graduating, I moved back to New York City to be closer to my family. Within 4 short years of living here, I purchased a house in Brooklyn in February of 2018. 

I work for a medical company here in Brooklyn and have a lot of hobbies. One of my biggest hobbies is saltwater fish tanks, which lead me to my next favorite hobby of scuba diving! I try to scuba dive around the world at least twice a year. 

I also own two motorcycles and ride them all over the country with friends. I love to snowboard in the winter time when I am not riding motorcycles. 

I love to travel. I have scuba dived in many places, ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, zip lined the jungles in Costa Rica, snowmobiled mountains on the east coast, partied hard in Berlin, Germany, sailed the Exuma Islands, Bahamas, swam with sharks, raced motorcycles, and the list continues to grow. 

I love to cook, travel, ride motorcycles, run around New York City, drink with friends, listen to hip-hop, and live my life to the fullest!

When it comes to you living in my home I am sure to give you your space! I am always here to help guide you around New York City. I have plenty of recommendations for foods, bars, clubs, museums, parks, hidden gems, etc. I know Brooklyn like the back of my hand and am always here to help :)

I would envision myself roller skating to school, going to see the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center or swimming at the beach on Coney Island.  By the time I was four, I was determined to move to New York City when I grew up.  
Which I did.  And I raised my own four children here on a diverse block with the whole city as their school and playground.
They are all grown up now and their rooms lie empty.  The treehouse from which one could see Central Park is still in our backyard; their video games are still in the play loft we built for them; many of their surviving toys are in the room where my grandchildren play when they come to visit. 
But for days on end no children are here.
Meanwhile there are children all over the world who grow up with images of New York on their TV screens, in their books and in their movies.  They, too, want to experience the city for themselves.  And their parents want to bring them; but there are no other affordable accommodations specifically designed for families.  The only children who ever get to see New York are the offspring of the 1%.  
At this B&B, families can strengthen their bonds and create lifelong memories together as they visit all the iconic New York sites: The Statue of Liberty, Times Square, The Museum of Natural History.  But their children are also getting a taste of what it's like to be a New York City kid: playing stoop ball off our front steps, running through the sprinkler on our play street, eating ices off the corner hand truck.
In short, AIRBNB is New York City's ambassador to future generations.  Who knows?  They may grow up and bring their kids here to see this city, too, someday.",within a few hours,1.00 ,0.00 ,f,East Harlem,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,f

THE SPACE:

LOCATION:
The apartment is located in a clean and safe neighborhood in Midtown East, minutes from attractions like Central Park, Saks Fifth Avenue, Grand Central, Bryant Park, United Nations, and a variety of restaurants, cafes and bars. All major subway and bus lines are within a 5-minute walk away. 

CONCIERGE SERVICES ($20/hr): 
- Shopping (grocery or other retail)
- Luggage assistance
- Transportation 
- Reservations
- Laundry
- Mid-stay cleaning
- Gym access

HOUSE RULES:
I pride myself in keeping a clean home and being respectful of my neighbors. I kindly ask that you do the same during your stay, especially by avoiding any excessively noisy activities (overly-loud music/TV,  jumping or banging on floors/walls/ceiling). Lastly, please refrain from smoking and wearing thin high heels in the apartment, as the smell will linger and the heels will damage the floors.

Thank you for reading and I hope to welcome you soon :) ",within a few hours,1.00 ,0.87 ,f,,2,2,['phone'],t,t

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

I travel, trying to fit my dream destinations into my limited vacation days, planing to visit Portugal this fall and maybe Germany in the spring next year if I can find a time.  South America and Central America has always been on my mind but the dates never worked out so I haven't got a chance to go :/  The place I miss the most is Cuba, didn't enjoy that much of the hot weather but everything else in this country is just amazing, mind-blowing in a way.

I cook, and am a pretty good cook actually.  I invite my guests to share my cooking, through food I find it easy to learn different cultures :)

I enjoy arts, managed to start a career in theatre and doing fine so far.  If you need a tour of cultural activities in NYC, I'll be your best guide!

I am a horticulture enthusiast, obsessed about travel, and a very special music band named Pearl Jam.  

I consider myself to be a very open-minded person that is compassionate about all life and nature. Travel has taught me to consider what it's like to walk in other people's shoes. I am not shy about voicing dissent or disagreement.  I believe that you receive what you put out and I strive to be a model of how I wish others would be; considerate and reflective.  

I have a major travel bug that never lets me rest. I have been all over the Americas, Europe, Australia, and various parts of Asia and Oceania. I am often contemplating ways to escape to a new or old favorite destination. I enjoy being immersed in other cultures, learning from other people, trying new foods, learning about other people's history and customs. A sucker for craft beer and homemade gnocchi!

At the present time, I am employed as an Academic Adviser at a prestigious University, where I incorporate all the skills I have cultivated over the years to work with students to achieve their educational goals of obtaining their college degree.  

In my spare time, I enjoy reading the Bible (Old Testament), fiction novels, listening to music (spiritual,
R & B and almost any kind of music with good rhythm), cooking new and old favorite recipes for my family members and friends.   Though I am a social person who enjoy making people laugh, I also frequently meditate.  This time allows me to plan my next course of action for the week and/or just prepare for bible study. Enjoyable to me also, is sightseeing, exploring the different sights not yet seen, in different neighborhoods, boroughs and dinning at different restaurants to their culture and eateries. One of the best occasions is watching the Yankee baseball game at the Yankee Taven on a large screen, to include championship boxing, soccer, NFL football, NBA Basketball, ice skating as well as figure skating and Polo. I am a die-heart sports fan.

I enjoy life to the fullest and hope that the guest that come to reside at my place will be comfortable and will gladly return because of the cleanliness of my home, respect shown to ever guest and how welcome they felt when they stayed at my residence.

I am originally from Kansas and started traveling internationally in high school.  I studied abroad in Spain as well as in Italy in college, and after we had kids about 15 years ago, I needed to be sure that international travel could still be a part of our lives, so we went to Mexico when our daughter was 4 months old, and I took her to London at 12 months with my sister.  

Since then, we have traveled around Switzerland, London, Denmark, Sicily, Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Canada, Croatia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand, among other trips stateside.  Our last big trips were sailing in Croatia and hiking in the Swiss Alps and scuba diving in Roatan, Honduras (the kids were certified as Junior divers  a couple years ago). We hope to continue our adventures for many years to come. 

David is an Assistant Principal at an alternative high school, and I am a Statistician, doing research in sea-level change.  We love to enjoy the amazing food and culture in Brooklyn and elsewhere, so we have taken advantage of the possibility of subsidizing a bit of our travel by putting our home on Airbnb while we are away having our own adventures.

I speak English, Hmong, French (tr猫s mal), Spanish (un poquito) and can sing the Lao national anthem and a short song in Swahili. 

My husband and I are filmmakers/writers and like to have authentic experiences when we travel.  We hate resorts and sheltered travel experiences.  A cruiseship seems like death to us.  We would rather drive a car into unknown places than take a bus to the fancy spots.  We make amazing travel videos from our trips and love exploring remote parts of the world.  We've camped on quiet beaches in Lanai, hiked Hmong farmlands in northern Thailand, fished the salmon run in Alaska, stargazed into the vast emptiness on the Namib desert, wandered the streets of Barcelona past midnight, portaged the Boundary Waters, dove with the sharks, rays, and eels in Belize, drove a dog sled in Yellowstone, filmed prosthetics clinics in Battambang, played guitar all night at a 24-hr pig smoke in Tennessee, laughed at the hyenas in Kruger, sailed the Greek isles, and created f/x make up in Morocco.  Until space tourism becomes a reality, we are content exploring this planet as much as possible; she has so much to offer and we strive to be gentle and gracious stewards of her gifts.

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

I love hiking, biking, local foods, street art, and dancing! I am usually up for anything.

I think many of the more seemingly simple experiences in life are overlooked, and some of the most profound travel opportunities come from listening to the local people who have created the culture (that's why I love AirBnb!).

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

I've been living in New York for many years, but am always in awe when go, for instance to Times Square. To simply stand there, looking at those billboards, lights... I always try to count how many ""televisions"" there are but I always loose count... There are whole buildings that are televisions.. It's just fascinating!

For the more relaxed times I *love* my charming neighborhood... In the Lower East Side (LES) things are calmer... There are tree-lined, European-like narrow streets, lovely coffee-shops, restaurants with tables on the streets... bars with live music... lots of green gardens, flowers, families with kids, hip, young professionals, and *lots* of amazing little places, restaurants, bakeries, boutiques, theaters, cinemas. That's why I chose to live here. 

It's a super-super safe, area, even late at night, I'm totally comfortable waking around at 2 or 3am - it's very intellectual, bohemian and artistic. 

It's one of the most ""happening"" neighborhoods, 
as well as SOHO and the Meatpacking.

In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.
In addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas.

My hobbies are listening to podcasts, reading, play with my loving Pomeranian dog, etc. I like to wake up early and look at morning sunlight while walking my dog. I train my dog everyday not bark too loud with full of excitement but it is often difficult for him because of his nature. I want future guests to understand this fact.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Please read my 鈥渉ouse rules鈥?before choosing me as your host, but keep an open mind (when reading) that after hosting for over 6+ years, you realize you need to have a bit of written structure for guests.  Otherwise my home would be in complete disarray. As this is not a hotel, it is someones home and should be treated as such.  Respect & manners for others (both host and guests), creates comfortability and a peaceful stay.  

about Me:
Respectful and good-hearted.  I'm well-mannered, friendly, but discreet.  Im caring, responsible, helpful, super clean, honest & extremely meticulous.  

I absolutely love hosting people (who are traveling the world and are in search of inexpensive accommodations), in my small but beautiful apartment.  Thankfully, I have been extremely lucky with all of my guests (please read my reviews)!
Reviews will give you confidence when making your choice as to where you wish to stay.
Important advice to new users on Airbnb.  Its really helpful if you have completely filled out your Airbnb profile when looking for a place.  Profile pictures and verifications such as, phone, email, drivers license or passport, and any social media platforms.  This really helps out the possible host and you will also have better luck with responses. 

PLEASE READ, BELOW!!!

Important message to any guests who are interested: 

The neighborhood where my apartment is located is listed on Airbnb as UES/East Harlem/Spanish Harlem or as it is known for is El Barrio also meaning ""the neighborhood.""  I can tell you how wonderful it is, because it is.  However, reading guest reviews are very important, in case you have any hesitation, I can assure you, reading my reviews will give you great confidence that you are choosing a great location (and host)! 

This neighborhood is safe, lovely, a mixture of all cultures and races and I have lived in this exact apartment (hosting) for 6+ years. The area (known as Upper East Side on the border of spanish harlem) has gentrified immensely.  I love it and don't plan to leave because it is a great place.  This building is also on the same block/street as a NYC police station, the fire dept., 24 hour gas station, 24 hour convenience stores and 24 hour laundry, right next door.  The building also has video intercom, so you can always see who is ringing the bell.  The street is always alive.  This IS the BIG Apple!

We use the profits from the guest rooms here to provide hot meals for homeless people on the streets of New York City.

Since the money you give us for your room is financing the meal distribution program, just by staying here, you're already helping to support this program.

We are two Venezuelan immigrants, we moved to NY in 2016 and we started doing Airbnb in 2017 at our small loft in Brooklyn as an initiative to create an extra income of money that could be used to help our families in Venezuela.

Through the months, our hospitality came to light and between guest and guest began to provide homemade breakfasts to create a better experience and increase our reviews.

What was the surprise? They loved the arepas and all the food from our country!

And yes, the reviews increased; highlighting our hospitality and food.

This is how Bonpland Underground was born, as a space for the enjoyment of a private dinner at home, excellent Venezuelan food with warmth of home (in our home), private chef and excellent service.
From there, we have incorporated our Executive Chef, business partner, and mentor, Edcar Trejo, Chef-owner of Barbecho Restaurant, located in M茅rida, Venezuela.
His incorporation into our team gives us the opportunity to raise our cuisine and our offers to the palate of international clients and has allowed to learn and merge more flavors with the criticism of our customers.

Welcome to my great international family in New York. Let me show you around.
I live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack.

As a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

I have lived in New York City all my life, and have lived at my current place for two years.. I am a student in Environmental Science and play music in two bands around Brooklyn, one for children (for example birthday parties for 5 year olds) and one rock and roll band, but I don't drink or smoke (don't mind other people who do)... I read alot of books and listen to alot of radio shows about science and international news- I ride my bike everywhere. If you stay at my house I will try and find you a bike!

I've travelled a little bit, to Europe (Sweden, Slovenia, Spain, France, Holland, Belgium, Germany), and to Mexico (D.F. mostly) and Israel but haven't left ny in the past few years. 
In the summer I try to go to the beach as much as possible. In the winter I visit friend's houses and drink tea. One day I would like to visit Africa, South America, the Artic and Papua New Guinea, (if I can ever save the money for the airline ticket :)  )
I can't live without books, friends, going for a walk once a day, trying to learn other languages (speak spanish, working on french, have taken classes in Greek, Japanese, Hebrew and Portuguese), and my family (they live in San Francisco)..

Our house is medium sized, but it has plenty of space for privacy, if you need your space after a long trip-  or for hanging out- we have a projector sometimes watch movies or listen to records in the living room- As far as hosting goes, I love New York and have many friends involved in all sides of it, from the arts/ music scenes to restaurants to activism- I know most neighborhoods in the city pretty well and am always happy to give people advice on where to go and what to do so they don't just see the stuff everyone sees.

I work at a bank doing capital stress testing (i.e. modeling how the bank survives a zombie apocalypse) and on the board of an NGO that helps children and refugees affected by war. I've got a thing for international politics and economics, and I'm pretty extroverted so always down for a good chat!

I went fully remote during the pandemic and I'm now a bit of a digital nomad, so after a decade of collecting gems in NYC (I'm partial to BK and Williamsburg over Manhattan), I'm now doing the same in LA and wherever else the wind (or a good recommendation) takes me.

I am originally from Kansas and started traveling internationally in high school.  I studied abroad in Spain as well as in Italy in college, and after we had kids about 15 years ago, I needed to be sure that international travel could still be a part of our lives, so we went to Mexico when our daughter was 4 months old, and I took her to London at 12 months with my sister.  

Since then, we have traveled around Switzerland, London, Denmark, Sicily, Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Canada, Croatia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand, among other trips stateside.  Our last big trips were sailing in Croatia and hiking in the Swiss Alps and scuba diving in Roatan, Honduras (the kids were certified as Junior divers  a couple years ago). We hope to continue our adventures for many years to come. 

David is an Assistant Principal at an alternative high school, and I am a Statistician, doing research in sea-level change.  We love to enjoy the amazing food and culture in Brooklyn and elsewhere, so we have taken advantage of the possibility of subsidizing a bit of our travel by putting our home on Airbnb while we are away having our own adventures.

As frequent travelers, and parents of two young boys (with another on the way), we never found hotels ideal for our needs as they often lacked the local character we were looking for and rarely provided space families need. We loved staying at Airbnbs but unfortunately had some unpleasant experience due to hosts that didn't take pride in their homes and the experience they provided.

As entrepreneurs, we decided to solve the problem ourselves which is why we started hosting ourselves and eventually created Rabbu. Rabbu is a full-service boutique-home experience company that provides guests with a local and authentic, yet consistently comfortable accommodation experience whether it be for one day or multiple months.

Keeping true to our backgrounds, Rabbu is inclusive of all guests no matter race or background. In fact, we encourage diversity and many of the properties that we operate are purposefully in true and authentic neighborhoods that feature lots of diversity and character. It truly is the best way to experience a city.

All of our units allow for self check-in and are professionally cleaned, provide free WiFi, toiletries and premium sheets/linens to ensure that guests have a comfortable experience. Guests will enjoy a worry-free stay while also being immersed in the authentic culture of the cities and neighborhoods they are visiting through our carefully selected and decorated spaces. We have also partnered with local service providers and restaurants to provide our guests with discounts, offers, services and recommendations which only locals are typically privileged to.

We live by a simple motto: 'Treat Others How You Wish To Be Treated' and that is the core value we have built Rabbu around. We want our guests to experience a city how we as travelers want to experience.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

from MGM. There is a soulfulness loved by the authentic locals as well as the out of Towner鈥檚 that gravitate here. The sensation of high energy is brought about by the contrast of old New York with the vigor of visitors to a burgeoning city. It's just the perfect scene to begin a story of your own or with someone of your choosing. There is room to mix in the crowd or make yourself noticed in a myriad of settings for human interaction; something surely missed in our time of impersonal communication. Any article about Orchard Street is incomplete without the newsworthy story of how the soul of a 5-story tenement filled with artifacts and personal affects became a stately eighth story hotel. Only a visit to the Historic Blue Moon can make one really understand how only on Orchard Street could art and history collide into such an elegant design.
The Historic Blue Moon was chosen as one in hundred and fifty hotels in the Western Hemisphere to check into by National Geographic as well as the recipient of over forty major articles.

8198,Sasha,2012/2/16,"New York, NY","I live in Bushwick with my partner, Mammad. We have a cozy brand new, luxury apartment in Bushwick, which is the artistic center of New York. When we first got to New York, it was hard to find the right place and we were moving from one Airbnb to the next, every few months for the first few years. We finally bought our place in Feb 2022 and we love it. It's the first home we've owned after living here for 10 years and we love everything about it - the street, the neighborhood, the people who live here. 

During the pandemic me and Mammad started a non-profit to tackle food insecurity in NYC. We've been working as volunteers on that project since New York went into lockdown, and in the first year of operation we cooked 150,000 meals. We also both have day jobs in tech and consulting too. 

For play - we live in Bushwick so there is something new to do every day! We love meeting new people, and New York is filled with the most diverse and brilliant set of people you can find. When we aren't in New York (and it isn't a global pandemic!) we are traveling around Europe, making new connections and hearing people's stories.

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

*I can speak Japanese as well! Please feel free to contact me in Japanese.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

*I can speak Japanese as well! Please feel free to contact me in Japanese.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

About me: I am a professional photographer, wife and mother.  I am originally from Los Angeles but have lived in New York for 20 years and it is home. Nothing but my intense love of the city brought me here after college. I have since lived in many different neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan, but I have to say, I've never loved an area so much as I love this particular part of Brooklyn. At this point in my life, with two young children, I really appreciate the quiet evenings, the feeling of community, and the great food that Brooklyn is famous for. Yet we remain very proximal to all the rest this incredible city has to offer. A 15 minute bike ride to Williamsburg or a 20 minute subway ride to downtown Manhattan, lots of beautiful historic buildings and greenspace. I truly feel the best of all worlds here. My husband is an architect and we spent 2 years renovating this home and the years since meticulously improving it. We have been here now for close to 10 years and we love all it offers our life. We like to take weekends to discover local places just outside the city limits. The beautiful beaches, swimming holes, hikes and trails of the area.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

*I can speak Japanese as well! Please feel free to contact me in Japanese.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Returning home, I witnessed first-hand the fragmented Tuscan Olive Oil industry, along with the slow extinction of an ancient craft. Something had to change, and so I decided to apply my business background to what I knew and make it better.

With Agricola Maraviglia, my mission is to cement a new and sustainable way of producing Tuscan Olive Oil, one that builds upon and honors past traditions. My hope is to share the lands of Maraviglia and the nourishing green gold it produces with the world鈥撯€搊ne bottle at a time.

My name is Rony. I'd say I'm coining the term ""business hipster,"" I'm an Assistant Buyer at Saks Fifth Avenue managing women's RTW collections. It's an awesome job and I love to talk about it! But when I'm not focusing on work I'm usually out in the neighborhood chatting with the neighbors, making new friends, out dancing, at concerts all the time! 
Finally when I'm exhausted of all that I love to just binge on some netflix on the big screen!

Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

I love good art, literature, film & performance, and am moved by political and spiritual practice. I've been lucky to travel and live all over the world. 

You'll see evidence of a lot of these activities in my apartment, which has hundreds of books in various languages, some hard-to-find foreign films, yoga mats -- all of which  you're welcome to use -- as well as other traces of my life in the world out there. My place has been described as inviting and homey, and bears little resemblance to those icky, sterile hotel rooms. I travel a lot, and have hosted many people in my home - both in my absence and in my presence. It's eerily quiet, yet wildly convenient to everywhere -- from Manhattan to Long Island and beyond -- though when I'm in NYC, I love spending time in my amazing Brooklyn neighborhood!

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don鈥檛 require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What鈥檚 more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
鈥?
鈥?) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That鈥檚 What We鈥檙e About:
There鈥檚 no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others鈥?discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There鈥檚 really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that鈥檚 ready for you on day one.
鈥?
鈥?) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we鈥檙e also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
鈥?
鈥?) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable.

鈥?) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn鈥檛 find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. 鈥淲e live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.鈥?鈥?
鈥?) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won鈥檛 invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
鈥?
鈥?) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver鈥檚 goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn鈥檛 stop here. Our guests鈥?dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them鈥攑owering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,1.00 ,0.67 ,t,Harlem,119,280,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

When we first got to New York, it was hard to find the right place and we were moving from one Airbnb to the next, every few months for the first few years. We finally bought our place in Feb 2022 and we love it. It's the first home we've owned after living here for 10 years and we love everything about it - the street, the neighborhood, the people who live here. 

During the pandemic me and Mammad started a non-profit to tackle food insecurity in NYC. We've been working as volunteers on that project since New York went into lockdown, and in the first year of operation we cooked 150,000 meals. We also both have day jobs in tech and consulting too. 

For play - we live in Bushwick so there is something new to do every day! We love meeting new people, and New York is filled with the most diverse and brilliant set of people you can find. When we aren't in New York (and it isn't a global pandemic!) we are traveling around Europe, making new connections and hearing people's stories.

I am from Zurich, Swiss/Persian, have lived in NYC for a decade and I'm an actress.  I've lived in many parts of NYC over the years and ultimately fell in love with the most gorgeous neighborhood in Brooklyn: Park Slope.
Nothing beats the beauty and community and history of this neighborhood: Prospect Park is by far more beautiful and adventurous than central park and only two blocks away.  If you like to sit in coffee shops and work you'll have plenty of film worthy options. There are bars, restaurants, and gyms galore. And if you need to go to Manhattan that's just a train ride away, with the station being steps away. 
The apartment is placed on the third floor of a four-story walk-up building. There is a balcony, exposed brick, and the bedrooms are on two opposite ends, providing enough privacy for everyone. Since the pandemic the apartment has received a nice upgrade, there is a humongous Roku TV, a stationary Schwinn bike, a blue wall for actors, a Nespresso machine, AC, cozy evening lights, and a desk in both bedrooms. I'm fully vaccinated - hope you are too. Please send me as many questions as you need to ask. And I'll be thrilled to offer an amazing Brooklyn home experience to you.

It doesn't allow me to truly experience the places and cultures I travel to. One of my favorite memories of traveling was when I was 17 and a friend and I back packed throughout Europe. I was visiting Naples, Italy, initially to see Pompeii and Isle of Capri but what caught my eye was when I walking through Naples streets and seeing children playing soccer (Football)  all around. They were laughing and having the time of their lives. That was the Italy I wanted to see and remains vivid in my memory ever since. 

What I can't live without?  My huge Irish family, my beautiful lovable puppy Alora, amazing foods, of course exploring, and wonderful friends to experience life with.

My favorite book is Harry Potter. In my defense, I started reading them when I was young and grew up with the series. And as far as movies go, Lord of the Rings hands down.

Um, born in China, moved to Sweden at a young age, then to Tempe and Tucson, AZ, then to Bloomburg, PA (the only town!), finally to New York for college. Been here since, but my heart belongs elsewhere (swoon -- but where? who knows). Finally moved to Brooklyn in August of 2015, and now just living the vagabond life. Well, not really, but trying to travel more. While I'm gone, mi casa es su casa!


A few more tidbits about me...

I love music and food, and everything in between. Always up to try new things. Can dance like a nut. Don't prefer eating nuts but will happily do so since it's sustenance.

Despite appearances, I haven't traveled all that much, but I am actively looking to change that. Gonna make my first trip outside of North/Central America--not including traveling with parents to China to visit relatives--very soon, will update this bio when that happens, maybe.

Traveling -- I like to travel light, stay in local places, don't cause a scene, make the bed each morning (hey I've read it's good for your mental well-being).

Hosting -- I host friends and family so often, and have been given 5/5 stars on each occasion, except that one time when I didn't wake up my friend to move his car and she got a parking ticket, but c'mon that ain't my responsibility. Kidding aside, I'm really chill, all about mutual respect, etc. If I'm home I'll even make coffee!

9981,Historic Blue Moon,2021/7/8,"New York, NY","I'm Randy Settenbrino the artist who created the Historic Blue Moon and have been on Orchard Street from my teenage years as well as most of my professional life. The historic facades, merchants and eclectics give it the ambiance of a back lot 
from MGM. There is a soulfulness loved by the authentic locals as well as the out of Towner鈥檚 that gravitate here. The sensation of high energy is brought about by the contrast of old New York with the vigor of visitors to a burgeoning city. It's just the perfect scene to begin a story of your own or with someone of your choosing. There is room to mix in the crowd or make yourself noticed in a myriad of settings for human interaction; something surely missed in our time of impersonal communication. Any article about Orchard Street is incomplete without the newsworthy story of how the soul of a 5-story tenement filled with artifacts and personal affects became a stately eighth story hotel. Only a visit to the Historic Blue Moon can make one really understand how only on Orchard Street could art and history collide into such an elegant design.
The Historic Blue Moon was chosen as one in hundred and fifty hotels in the Western Hemisphere to check into by National Geographic as well as the recipient of over forty major articles.

Moving to Park Slope, Brooklyn started out as a coincidence... With time I realized how lucky I was, to stumble upon this laid back and yet vibrant, green and beautiful neighborhood, that is less than 20 min subway ride to Manhattan, and make it my home.
In my free time I like to listen to live music (Barbes, a wonderful jazz club and bar is only a short walk from me), watch movies (if you'd like, I'll direct you to the best independent/art-house cinemas of Manhattan), see an exhibit in one of NY's museums and galleries (it is very easy to get to the Brooklyn Museum from my home) or explore Prospect Park, just a couple of blocks away. I also enjoy the huge variety of restaurants and cafes in my ""hood"".
